# Palindrome Checker

## Problem Description
A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case. The task is to determine whether a given string **is a palindrome** or **is not a palindrome**.

## Examples

### Example 1
- **Input:** `"madam"`
- **Output:** `is a palindrome`

### Example 2
- **Input:** `"race a car"`
- **Output:** `is not a palindrome`



## Explanation
- **Example 1:** `"madam"` is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.
- **Example 2:** `"race a car"` is not a palindrome because reversing it gives `"rac ecar"` which is different from the original.


## Constraints
- The input is a single word without spaces.
- The input consists of lowercase and/or uppercase letters only.
- The function should be case-insensitive (i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as the same).
