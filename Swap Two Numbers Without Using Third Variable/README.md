# Swap Two Numbers Without Using Third Variable

## Problem Description

Write a program to swap two given numbers without using a third variable. The task is to modify the values of the two variables such that the first variable contains the value of the second, and the second variable contains the value of the first.

## Example
### Example 1

**Input:**
```
a = 5, b = 10
```
**Output:**
```
a = 10, b = 5
```
### Example 2
**Input:**
```
a = 7, b = -3
```
**Output:**
```
a = -3, b = 7
```


## Constraints
- The values of `a` and `b` are integers.
- The values of `a` and `b` can be positive, negative, or zero.
- You **cannot** use a third variable to complete the swap.
