# Reverse an Array

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers, the task is to reverse the array in-place. This means that the elements at the start of the array are swapped with the elements at the end, working inward until the entire array is reversed.

You need to write a function that takes an integer array as input and returns the array with the elements reversed.

## Example

**Input:**

```
Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
**Output:**
```
Reversed Array: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
## Constraints

- **Array Size**: 
  - The array size must be between `1` and `100,000`.
- **Element Values**: 
  - Each element of the array is an integer, where `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`.
