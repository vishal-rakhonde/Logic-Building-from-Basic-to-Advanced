# Factorial of a Given Number

## Problem Description

The **factorial** of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. It is denoted as `n!` and is defined as:

- `n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1`
- By definition, `0! = 1`

The goal is to calculate the factorial of a given number `n`.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
5
```

**Output:**
```
120
```
**Explanation:**
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

## Constraints:
- `0 <= n <= 12`
