# Swap Two Strings

## Problem Description

You are given two strings `str1` and `str2`. Your task is to swap the values of these two strings without using any temporary or third variable. 

After swapping, `str1` should contain the original value of `str2`, and `str2` should contain the original value of `str1`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input :** 
```
str1 = "hello", str2 = "world"
```
**Output :** 
```
str1 = "world", str2 = "hello"
```

### Example 2:
**Input :** 
```
str1 = "apple", str2 = "banana"
```
**Output :** 
```
str1 = "banana", str2 = "apple"
```

## Constraints

- The length of `str1` and `str2` will be in the range: `1 <= str.length <= 100`.
- The strings will consist of lowercase English letters only.
